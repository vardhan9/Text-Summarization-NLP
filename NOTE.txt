Important to remember:


All the end t oend implemention worked OK

1. Data is trained on test set due to limited CPU resources
2. Go through throughly research/text-summarizer.ipynb, 
this notebook is available in kaggle. Trained with kaggle GPUs.
3. This is end to end text summarization implementation of krish naik's course
4. Raw data is pulled from ntbappy github, course instructor
5. AWS implementation : NOT yet done
6. artifacts are not uploaded, they are about 2.2GB.

Improvements to be done:
1. Train the model with train dataset, save it and evaluate it.
2. After this update the ipynb note books with updated code and evalution metrics
